        Please list your group members (as their name appears on Canvas) below. You may form groups of 1 to 3
        students. Groups cannot exceed 3 students.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, be sure to join a group within Canvas > People > Web Project Groups.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, decide on a project, give it a meaningful title (e.g. Library System) and a brief project description
        (200-300 words). See Canvas for examples of project ideas. Whatever your proposed project is, it is
        expected to have an interactive element.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
        When you are finished, save this document as a PDF and upload it to Canvas!

                MadForum is a lightweight campus forum focused on two use cases:
                (1) rehoming second-hand furniture and (2) posting small paid
                "bounty" tasks such as moving, assembly, or pickup. The app
                intentionally avoids online payments—people coordinate offline—so
                the backend remains simple and safe. The core interactive flows are:
                discovering items and tasks with rich filters, creating a post with photos
                and tags, and coordinating through threaded comments.
            </p>
            <p>
                The feed supports quick filters (type: sale/free/bounty), price or reward
                range, tags, status (open/claimed/completed/closed), and text search.
                Each post page shows an image gallery, description, location text,
                badges (e.g., "Bounty", "Free"), and a comment thread where
                interested users can ask questions or express intent. Authors can edit,
                close, or soft-delete their own posts; admins can moderate comments.
                The status lifecycle is intentionally small– open -> claimed -> completed
                -> closed—and expired posts can auto-close.
            </p>
            <p>
                To keep the project feasible, we will build the backend with Supabase
                (Postgres + Auth + Storage) or a minimal Express + SQLite service. The
                schema includes four tables (users, posts, post_images, comments).
                The UI is built with React + TypeScript + Tailwind and emphasizes
                responsive design, inline validation, drag-and-drop photo upload, and
                live preview when posting. Stretch goals include watchlists, simple
                DMs, and map-style location picking. MadForum demonstrates
                meaningful interactivity, clear data modeling, and practical value for
                students while staying well within the course timeline.
